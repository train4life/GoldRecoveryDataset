    "1. We were predicting the amount of oil reserves in the previous project, in this project there is no `volume of predicted reserves` to speak of :)\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "3. SMAPE is symmetric mean average percentage *error*, so lower values are better.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The test set should not be used to compare different models. Its only purpose is to get an unbiased estimate of how well the final model generalizes to new data which was not used for training/hyperparameter tuning/model selection. If we use the test set to compare the models, that assumption is broken, and the test set score of the final model will be overly optimistic. To avoid it we can use cross-validation on the train set to compare different models, select the best one, and only evaluate that one model on the test set.\n",
